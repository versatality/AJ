<div> <h2> CLIMATE CHANGE </H2> 
 <img src="cc1.jpg"; class="img"></img>  
<p  style="font-color:black"> Climate Change is the defining issue of our time and we are at a defining moment.
 From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production, to rising sea levels that increase the risk of
 catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Without 
 drastic action today, adapting to these impacts in the future will be more difficult and costly.<br><br>

<b>The Human Fingerprint on Greenhouse Gases</b><br>
Greenhouse gases occur naturally and are essential to the survival of humans and millions of other living things,
 by keeping some of the sun’s warmth from reflecting back into space and making Earth livable. But after more than
 a century and a half of industrialization, deforestation, and large scale agriculture, quantities of greenhouse gases
 in the atmosphere have risen to record levels not seen in three million years. As populations, economies and standards
 of living grow, so does the cumulative level of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions.<br><br>

<b>There are some basic well-established scientific links:</b><br><img src="cc2.jpg" style="float:right;

<ul>
<li>The concentration of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere is directly linked to the average global temperature on Earth;</li>
<li>The concentration has been rising steadily, and mean global temperatures along with it, since the time of the Industrial
 Revolution;</li>
<li>The most abundant GHG, accounting for about two-thirds of GHGs, carbon dioxide (CO2), is largely the product of burning 
fossil fuels.</li></ul>
<b>The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</b><br>
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and United Nations
 Environment to provide an objective source of scientific information. In 2013 the IPCC provided more clarity about the role of 
 human activities in climate change when it released its Fifth Assessment Report. It is categorical in its conclusion: climate
 change is real and human activities are the main cause.<br><br>

<b><i>Fifth Assessment Report</b></i><br>
The report provides a comprehensive assessment of sea level rise, and its causes, over the past few decades. It also estimatesimg 
<img src="cc3.jpg" class="img">
</img>
 cumulative CO2 emissions since pre-industrial times and provides a CO2 budget for future emissions to limit warming to less 
 than 2°C. About half of this maximum amount was already emitted by 2011. The report found that:
<ul>
<li>From 1880 to 2012, the average global temperature increased by 0.85°C.</li>
<li>Oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished and the sea level has risen. From 1901 to 2010, the global average
 sea level rose by 19 cm as oceans expanded due to warming and ice melted.</li> <li> The sea ice extent in the Arctic has shrunk in every 
 successive decade since 1979, with 1.07 × 106 km² of ice loss per decade.</li>
<li>Given current concentrations and ongoing emissions of greenhouse gases, it is likely that by the end of this century global mean
 temperature will continue to rise above the pre-industrial level. The world’s oceans will warm and ice melt will continue.</li>
<li> Average sea level rise is predicted to be 24–30 cm by 2065 and 40–63 cm by 2100 relative to the reference period of 1986–2005.
<img src="cc4.jpg" class="img"></img>
 Most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries, even if emissions are stopped.</li></ul><br><br>
There is alarming evidence that important tipping points, leading to irreversible changes in major ecosystems and the planetary
 climate system, may already have been reached or passed. Ecosystems as diverse as the Amazon rainforest and the Arctic tundra,
 may be approaching thresholds of dramatic change through warming and drying. Mountain glaciers are in alarming retreat and the
 downstream effects of reduced water supply in the driest months will have repercussions that transcend generations.<p></div><br><br><br>
<div> <h2 > INDIA WITH OBESITY </H2>
 <P>Obesity is a condition where a person has accumulated abnormal or excessive body fat that causes negative effects on health. For an individual,
 obesity is usually the result of an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expanded. An increased consumption of high calorie foods,
 without an equal increase in physical activity leads to an increase in weight. Decreased levels of physical activity will also result in an energy 
 imbalance and lead to weight gain.<BR>

Once it was thought as a problem of high income countries now the problem of overweight and obesity are increasing in low income and middle income 
countries especially in urban areas. Since 1980 obesity has doubled worldwide. In 2014 more than 1.9 billion adults (18 years and older) and 41 million
 children under the age of five were overweight. Nearly half of the children under five who were overweight or obese in 2014 lived in Asia.<BR>

Overweight and obesity are emerging health problems in India. According to National family health survey India-3 (NFHS-3), thirteen percent of women
 (15-49 Years) and nine percent of men (15-49 Years) were overweight or obese in 2005-06. Overweight prevalence was higher in urban areas than rural
 areas and lower in people who are involved in agriculture or manual work.<BR>

World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight and obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A simple measure
 commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults is body mass index (BMI).  BMI is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square
 of his height in meters (kg/m2). WHO identifies overweight when BMI is greater than or equal to 25; and obesity when BMI is greater or equal to 30. In Asians, 
 the cut-offs for overweight (≥23.0kg/m2) and obesity (≥25.0kg/m2) are lower than WHO criteria due to risk factors and morbidities.<BR>

Overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight and act as a predisposing factor for non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases
 (heart attack and stroke), diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders (osteoarthritis), some cancers (including breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and colon).<BR>

Obesity during childhood also causes breathing difficulties, increased risk of fractures, hypertension, and psychological effects. In later life with high chances
 of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes can lead to disability and premature death.<br>

Overweight, obesity and their related non-communicable disease are preventable. By making the choice of healthier food and regular physical activity overweight and
 obesity can be prevented. </p></div><br><br><br>
